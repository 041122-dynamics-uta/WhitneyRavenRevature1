Abigail, Oliver, Rosa, and Blake all attend the same summer camp, where they can cook, kayak, rock climb, and zip-line. Each child has a different favorite activity.Abigail’s favorite activity isn’t rock climbing.
• Oliver is afraid of heights.
• Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness.
• Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.
Can you figure out who likes what? 

• Abigail = zip lining; Oliver = kayaking; Rosa = rock climbing; Blake = cooking
1) Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground, and cooking is the only activity that takes place on terra firma, so that one must be his favorite.
2) Oliver is afraid of heights, so zip-lining and rock climbing are both out.  Since Blake is already matched with cooking, the only option is kayaking.
3) The only two remaining options are rock climbing and zip-lining.  Since it states that Abigail's favorite isn't rock climbing, it must be zip-lining, which leaves rock climbing for Rosa (who also needs to wear a harness for her favorite activity).
