The Long and the Short of It:

Here’s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.
• Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
• Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
• Benito is not the shortest.
Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?

• Charlotte < Benito < Leisha < Delia < Weldon < Zina

1) Weldon is shorter than Zina, but taller than Delia, who is taller than Leisha, who is taller than Benito.
2) Since we know Benito is not the shortest, but every name mention is taller than him, he must be the second shortest.
3) Process of elimination leaves Charlotte as the shortest.
