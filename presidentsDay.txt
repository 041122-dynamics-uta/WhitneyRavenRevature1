Presidents Day:

George, William, John, Abe, and Millard have their birthdays on consecutive days, all between Monday and Friday.
• George’s birthday is as many days before Millard’s *and* 
   William’s is after Abe’s.
• John is two days older than Abe.
• Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.
Can you figure out whose birthday is on each day?

• John = Mon; George = Tues; Abe = Wed; Millard = Thur; William = Fri

ASSUMPTION: the *and* in the first rule is presumed to be a typo and is intended to be an as, but the correct order matches both and/as.

1) We know that George's birthday is before Millard's, which is on Thursday, so George's can be Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
2) John's birthday is before Abe's by two days, so Abe can only be on a Wednesday or Friday.
3) Since William's birthday is after Abe's, then Abe can only be on Wednesday and Friday must be William's.
4) John is two days older than Abe, so John must be on Monday.
5) Process of elimination leaves George with Tuesday.
